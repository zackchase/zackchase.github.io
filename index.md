Welcome to my website. 
I am currently the Raj Reddy Associate Professor 
of Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
I hold appointments in the Machine Learning Department
in the School of Computer Science,
the Heinz School of Public Policy (courtesy)
and Societal Computing (courtesy). 
My research spans core ML methods and theory, 
their applications in healthcare and natural language processing, 
and critical concerns, both about the mode of inquiry itself, 
and the impact of the technology it produces on social systems. 

I am also the Cofounder & CTO of Abridge,
a healthcare AI company defining the cutting edge
of technology in the emerging ambient listening space. 
Our industry-leading product listens to doctor-patient conversations
and ingests reams of content from the EHR, 
leveraging an intelligent reasoning engine to generate
high-quality drafts of after-visit notes & other artifacts.
This automation frees up doctors to focus on the patient (during the visit)
and to focus mostly on last-mile edits (after the visit). 
Bringing this vision to life takes scientific innovation 
on every component of the technical stack,
and new creative approaches to monitoring, evaluating, and adapting our models
in light of changing patterns of usage. 

I completed my PhD at UCSD in the Artificial Intelligence Group,
and I'm a huge fan, it's the perfect place to find your groove. 
The faculty are brilliant, the weather is inspiring,
the intensity level is just right.
If I had a time machine, I'd go back, 
take two years longer to graduate, 
and actually learn to surf.

At CMU, I direct the [Approximately Correct Machine Intelligence (ACMI) Lab](https://acmilab.org), 
a group of wonderful students whose creativity and talent are the primary reasons
why my perennial threats to relocate to a small island in the Aegean Sea remain idle jests.
Once I can no longer attract such talented kids to inspire me,
I plan to abscond to Amorgos, 
where I will passively supervise a herd of goats,
slowly acquire the centuries-old craft of distilling spirits from local herbs, 
and devote the rest of my life to writing third-rate science fiction novels.

My lab's focuses include (i) building robust systems that can cope with a changing world,
whether due to natural changes in the environment
(so-called natural distribution shifts)
or due to the strategic manipulations 
of other agents keen to influence automated decisions; 
(ii) understanding the social impacts of machine learning in a philosophically coherent way;
(iii) the intersection of representation learning and causality; 
and (iv) leveraging ML to address impactful questions in clinical medicine.
Across these many concerns, I tend to favor applications 
involving natural language data, and expect this interest to endure.


I value clear scientific prose.
My expository efforts have included 
(i) an interactive book, (Dive into Deep Learning)[https://d2l.ai],
which teaches deep learning through exposition, math and code
in a fully-interactive textbook written in Jupyter 
and automatically compiled to HTML and PDF 
(forthcoming on Cambridge University Press); 
(ii) several reviews of the literature (most notably on RNNs and Differential Privacy);
and (iii) Approximately Correct, a blog, launched in 2016 to bridge
technical and social perspectives on machine learning. 


For now, I plan to keep this site static,
referring visitors to [ACMI lab's website](https://acmilab.org) 
for dynamically update content, including recent papers, 
current students, and other news.
